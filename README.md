# Number-Guessing-GameIn this version:

    Error Handling: The try-catch block is used to handle non-integer inputs. If the user enters something that's not an integer, the program will catch a FormatException and prompt them to enter a valid integer.

    Guess Limit: The game now limits the number of guesses to maxGuesses. This variable can be adjusted to any number you prefer.

    End Game Conditions: The game ends either when the user guesses the correct number or when they run out of guesses. The program informs the user whether they guessed correctly or not.

This enhanced version makes the game more robust and user-friendly. You can further modify and extend the game as needed, such as adding difficulty levels or providing hints.
